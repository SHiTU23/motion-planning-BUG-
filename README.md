# motion-planning-BUG1 & 2 Algorithms
finding a path -using Bug algorithms- from start point to target with obstacles in way
- worked only rectangular obstacles 
Any number of obstacle can be added to the environment. only 4 corner points needed, 'rect_generator' func takes onlu one corner coordinates and rectangle angle and returns all needed points.
